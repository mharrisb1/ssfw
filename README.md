# ðŸª¬ ssfw - Super simple file watcher

A minimal file watcher that watches for modifications to files and executes a command in the foreground.

## Usage

The program expects a set of files to watch and an optional command to run when one
of the watched files has changed. If you do not provide a command then the program will
run a no-op command in the shell.

```bash
ssfw --pattern 'src/**' --command 'cargo test'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note the use of single quotes around the glob. This is required.

## Help

```bash
ðŸª¬ Super simple file watcher

Usage: ssfw [OPTIONS] --pattern <PATTERN>

Options:
  -p, --pattern <PATTERN>  Monitoring path/glob
  -c, --command <COMMAND>  Run command [default: :]
      --root <ROOT>        Optional root
      --poll <POLL>        Poll duration (ms) [default: 500]
      --sh <SH>            Shell to execute command in [default: zsh] [possible values: zsh, bash]
  -v, --verbose...         Increase logging verbosity
  -q, --quiet...           Decrease logging verbosity
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```

## Variables

Sometimes you will just want to run a given command on the exact file or files that have changed
and not to the entire file set. To do this, you can make use of the command variables.

### Supported Variables

| Name   | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `path` | Event detected file or dir path |

```bash
ssfw --path 'src/**/*.ts' --command 'eslint --fix {path}'
```

## Limitations

This program has a number of limitations compared to more mature and robust file watching services.
Some of these limitations are by design since this aims to be a "super simple" file watcher,
but some are from the program's immaturity, namely:

1. Use of file polling instead of using system events
2. Foreground execution only (this was a design choice and will likely not change)
3. Currently, no support for terminating a long-lived program executed by the command. Need to implement some sort of process group management and right now that is out of scope.

## Build

> [!WARNING]
> Only tested on Apple M1 Pro

Currently, the only option for using this tool is to build it from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mharrisb1/ssfw.git
cd ssfw
cargo build --release
```

Then add to path.

## Changelog

- [0.2.1](#021-2024-03-08)
- [0.2.0](#020-2024-03-07)

### [0.3.0] - 2024-03-14

Ran into an issue on a large project where the watcher was taking so long to diff that it became unusable. This release adds a new `--root` option
so you can specify an alternative root for the watcher other than `cwd`.

### [0.2.1] - 2024-03-08

Fixes issue where some commands will exit with status failed but will still pipe to stdout so the file watcher was not displaying the error message.

### [0.2.0] - 2024-03-07

Breaking change for `--path` command which is is now called `--pattern` and breaking change for `{fname}` variable which is now `{path}`.
